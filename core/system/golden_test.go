// golden is what three settlements on the default map came to after fifteen
// hundred days, as a hash of everything about them: where everyone is and
// what shape they are in, every tile of the ground, and how much has
// happened. It was taken before the world was made big enough to hold more
// than one settlement, and it is what every step of making it so is held
// against. The full batch in docs/baseline.md is the proof; this is the
// check that runs in seconds.
//
// A change meant to alter what a settlement does must retake these three
// numbers in the commit that makes it, and say so. A change that was not
// meant to and moves them was not what it was meant to be.
