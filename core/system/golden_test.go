// golden is what three settlements on the default map came to after fifteen
// hundred days, as a hash of everything about them: where everyone is and
// what shape they are in, every tile of the ground, and how much has
// happened. It was taken before the world was made big enough to hold more
// than one settlement, and it is what every step of making it so is held
// against. It was taken again when master was merged in, on master itself,
// and the merged tree came to the same three numbers. The full batch in docs/baseline.md is the proof; this is the
// check that runs in seconds.
//
// A change meant to alter what a settlement does must retake these three
// numbers in the commit that makes it, and say so. A change that was not
// meant to and moves them was not what it was meant to be.
//
// Retaken for the soil's make-up: there is rock under the ground now, the
// soil over it is a mixture of sand, silt and clay weathered out of that
// rock, and the water sorts what it carries so that the fine stuff ends up
// where the water slows. Fertility reads the mixture and so does how fast a
// hillside washes, which moves every map from the moment it is made; the full
// batch is in docs/baseline.md.
//
// Retaken before that for the lapse rate: the weather falls with the height
// of the ground, so the cold a body feels and the growing weather the ground
// gets are read where they are rather than off the row.
